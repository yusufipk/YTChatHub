# Contribution Guide: Fixing TypeScript import.meta Error

## Contribution Rules

## Problem

We encountered the following TypeScript error:
```
The 'import.meta' meta-property is not allowed in files which will build into CommonJS output. ts(1470)
```

## Root Cause

This error occurs when TypeScript tries to compile code using `import.meta` (an ES module feature) into CommonJS output format. The issue typically happens when there's a mismatch between the module system configured in TypeScript and the expected output format.

In our case, the error was occurring in `backend/src/index.ts` where we were using:
```typescript
if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
  startBackend().catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to start backend', error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
}
```

This is a common pattern in ES modules to detect if a file is being run directly (equivalent to `require.main === module` in CommonJS).

## Solution

We fixed the issue by:

1. **Improving the ES module detection logic** to be more robust:
   - Added proper imports for path resolution utilities
   - Created a more reliable check using `pathToFileURL` and `resolve`
   - Added error handling for edge cases

2. **Updated package.json scripts** to use consistent npm commands

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
  startBackend().catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to start backend', error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const isDirectExecution = (() => {
  const entry = process.argv[1];
  if (!entry) {
    return false;
  }
  try {
    const href = pathToFileURL(resolve(entry)).href;
    return import.meta.url === href;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
})();

if (isDirectExecution) {
  startBackend().catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to start backend', error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
}
```

**Additional imports added:**
```typescript
import { resolve } from 'node:path';
import { pathToFileURL } from 'node:url';
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Proper URL Resolution**: Instead of manually constructing the file URL, we use Node.js built-in utilities to properly resolve the path and convert it to a file URL.

2. **Error Handling**: The try/catch block ensures that if URL resolution fails for any reason, the application won't crash.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Using Node.js path utilities ensures the code works correctly across different operating systems.

4. **TypeScript Compatibility**: This approach is compatible with both ES module and CommonJS compilation targets.

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Check that the backend starts correctly
3. Verify there are no TypeScript errors related to import.meta
4. Confirm that the direct execution check still works as expected

## Additional Notes

- The package.json script changes were made to ensure consistent command usage across different environments
- This fix maintains the original functionality while resolving the TypeScript compilation error
- The solution is backward compatible and doesn't introduce any breaking changes

## Search and Filtering Feature Implementation 

We're currently working on implementing search and filtering functionality for chat messages in the YTChatHub dashboard. This feature will allow users to find specific messages quickly by searching text content and filtering by message types.

### Current Progress

1. Created a new branch `ui/message-search-filtering` for this feature
2. Developed a comprehensive implementation plan (see `memory-bank/search-filtering-plan.md` for details)

### Implementation Plan Overview

#### Backend Enhancements
- Extend the `/chat/messages` endpoint to accept query parameters for filtering
- Implement filtering logic for:
  - Text search across message content
  - Message type filtering (regular, superchat, membership)
  - Author filtering
  - Badge filtering (moderator, member, verified)

#### Frontend Implementation
- Add search input field for text search
- Add filter controls for message types
- Add author filter input
- Add badge filter checkboxes
- Implement proper state management for all filters

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**: Implement debouncing on search input (300-500ms delay)
2. **User Experience**: Preserve auto-scroll behavior when filtering narrows results
3. **UI/UX Design**: Ensure filter controls are responsive and don't clutter the interface

### Open Questions

1. Should we implement client-side or server-side filtering for better performance?
2. Should search include author names only or also message content?
3. Should filter settings be persisted in localStorage for the session?
4. How should we handle the case when filters return no results?
5. Should we support regex search or just simple text matching?

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic search and filter (text search + message type filtering)
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced filtering (author + badge filtering)
3. **Phase 3**: Performance and UX improvements (debouncing, loading states, etc.)
