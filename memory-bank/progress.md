# Progress Tracker

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- [x] Create Memory Bank documentation.
- [x] Simplify project layout (single package, shared types via alias).
- [ ] Document setup instructions for the new command set.

## Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure
- [x] Implement Innertube client bootstrap (retrieve context, manage continuation tokens).
- [ ] Build backend poller with full normalization, error/backoff handling, and persistence hooks.
- [x] Expose REST+SSE endpoints for chat and overlay delivery.

## Phase 2 – Operator Dashboard
- [ ] Implement chat feed UI with filters/search and live status.
- [x] Provide message selection controls and overlay preview basics.
- [ ] Handle error states (rate limits, disconnects) gracefully in UI.

## Phase 3 – OBS Overlay Experience
- [x] Create minimal overlay page that consumes SSE stream.
- [ ] Style overlay for production readability and ensure OBS compatibility testing.
- [ ] Add local preview enhancements (animations, theme controls).

## Phase 4 – Reliability & Polish
- [ ] Add optional persistence (SQLite) and crash recovery.
- [ ] Expand logging/metrics for long-stream observability.
- [ ] Write tests (unit/integration) and contributor documentation.

## Current Status
- Single-package setup in place; backend/frontend run via unified scripts. Awaiting validation on clean install, ingestion hardening, and richer dashboard UX.
