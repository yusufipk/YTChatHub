## Current Status
- **✅ YouTube Integration Live**: Backend connects to real YouTube Live chat and parses all message types
- **✅ Modern UI Complete**: Dashboard features centered layout, gradient backgrounds, badges, and superchat displays
- **✅ CORS Fixed**: Overlay SSE stream works cross-origin for OBS integration
- **✅ Rich Parsing**: Moderators, members, verified users, superchats, and membership gifts all detected and displayed. Currency parsing is now more robust.
- **✅ UI Polished**: The dashboard and overlay layouts have been refined for better spacing and alignment. The overlay now matches the dashboard's aesthetic.
- **✅ Auto-Scroll Implemented**: Chat panels now auto-scroll intelligently.
- **✅ Timestamp Resolution Fixed**: Critical bug resolved - timestamps now display correct current time instead of 1970 epoch
- **✅ Timezone Support**: All timestamps display in user's local timezone with browser detection and GMT+3 fallback
- **✅ Visual Selection States**: Three-tier feedback system (active/normal/previously-selected) for better UX
- **✅ Image Proxy Implemented**: Backend now proxies all YouTube CDN images (avatars, badges, emojis) with 24hr in-memory cache to prevent 429 rate limit errors
- **Next**: Add search/filter, error recovery, and polish UX details
