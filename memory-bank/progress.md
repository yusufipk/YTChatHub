- [x] Document setup instructions for the new command set.

## Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure
- [x] Implement Innertube client bootstrap (retrieve context, manage continuation tokens).
- [x] Build backend poller with full normalization and comprehensive message parsing.
- [x] Expose REST+SSE endpoints for chat and overlay delivery.
- [x] Fix CORS issues for cross-origin SSE connections.
- [x] Parse badges (moderator, member, verified), superchats, and membership gifts.

## Phase 2 – Operator Dashboard
- [x] Implement modern chat feed UI with live status indicators.
- [x] Display user avatars, badges, and special message types (superchats, memberships).
- [x] Provide message selection controls with visual feedback.
- [x] Centered layout with gradient backgrounds and glass-morphism effects.
- [x] Message count display and connection status.
- [x] Conditional auto-scrolling for chat panels.
- [x] Timezone-aware timestamp formatting for all messages.
- [x] Visual selection state management (active, normal, previously-selected).
- [ ] Add filters/search functionality.
- [ ] Handle error states (rate limits, disconnects) gracefully in UI.

## Phase 3 – OBS Overlay Experience
- [x] Create overlay page that consumes SSE stream at `/overlay`.
- [x] Style overlay with modern design including avatars, badges, and superchat displays.
- [x] Ensure transparent background for OBS browser source.
- [x] Display new member announcements on overlay.
- [x] Optimize overlay spacing for efficient use (30-40% more compact).
- [x] Remove timestamps from overlay for cleaner display.
- [x] Add smooth fade transitions when switching between messages.
- [ ] Add theme controls and customization options.

## Phase 4 – Reliability & Polish
- [x] Implement image proxy with caching to prevent YouTube CDN 429 errors.
- [x] Implement smart message storage that preserves superchats/memberships.
- [ ] Refactor the code
- [ ] Add log-in and unique stream id for each logged in user
- [ ] Ensure the deployment.
- [ ] Expand logging/metrics for long-stream observability.
- [ ] Write tests (unit/integration) and contributor documentation.

## Current Status
- **✅ YouTube Integration Live**: Backend connects to real YouTube Live chat and parses all message types
- **✅ Modern UI Complete**: Dashboard features centered layout, gradient backgrounds, badges, and superchat displays
- **✅ CORS Fixed**: Overlay SSE stream works cross-origin for OBS integration
- **✅ Rich Parsing**: Moderators, members, verified users, superchats, and membership gifts all detected and displayed. Currency parsing is now more robust.
- **✅ UI Polished**: The dashboard and overlay layouts have been refined for better spacing and alignment. Overlay is 30-40% more compact.
- **✅ Auto-Scroll Implemented**: Chat panels now auto-scroll intelligently.
- **✅ Timestamp Resolution Fixed**: Critical bug resolved - timestamps now display correct current time instead of 1970 epoch
- **✅ Timezone Support**: Dashboard timestamps display in user's local timezone with browser detection and GMT+3 fallback
- **✅ Visual Selection States**: Three-tier feedback system (active/normal/previously-selected) for better UX
- **✅ Image Proxy Implemented**: Backend now proxies all YouTube CDN images (avatars, badges, emojis) with 24hr in-memory cache to prevent 429 rate limit errors
- **✅ Overlay Animations**: Smooth fade-out/in transitions when switching between messages
- **✅ Smart Storage**: Regular messages limited to 200, superchats and memberships preserved for entire session
- **Next**: Add search/filter, error recovery, and polish UX details
